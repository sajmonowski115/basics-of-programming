***BASIC INFO***

Inter-VLAN routing- a way to forward traffic between different VLAN-s by implementing a router in the network

For a device inside a VLAN devices in another VLAN are on a remote subnet. Therefore, that device will contact its default gateway (the router) when trying to reach those devices.

Router on a Stick uses a single link to switch frames beetwen different vlans.

The router performs a specific Frame Rewrite operation: it changes the VLAN tag


***CONFIGURATION***

#NOTE: all the commands are performed on the router side

1. turning on the interface
(config)# int INT ID (for example: g0/1)
(config-if)# no shutdown

2. configuring subinterfaces
(config)# int SUB-INT ID (for example: g0/1.10)
(config-subif)# encapsulation dot1q VLAN ID (for example: 10)
(config-subif)# ip address IP ADDRESS MASK
for example: ip address 10.0.10.1 255.255.255.0

3. configuring native vlan (for untagged frames)
(config)# int SUB-INT ID (for example: g0/1.1)
(config-subif)# encapsulation dot1q VLAN ID native
for example: encapsulation dot1q 1 native

4. troubleshooting
# show running-config
