***BASIC INFO***

Port Security is a technology that restrict access to the network based on source MAC address.

Switch can learn a few thousend mac addresses. After its TCAM (ternary content-addressable memory) is full it will act as a hub

Port Security can only be configured on access ports hardcoded with switchport mode access, and not on trunks

There might be one of three actions specified what to do when a violation occurs:
^protect- silently drops traffic from any exceeding MAC
^restrict- drops traffic from any exceeding MAC and generates an alert
^shutdown- blocks the port and generates an alert

***CONFIGURATION***

#NOTE- turning on Port Security is mandatory for other commands to work

*force a port into an access mode port (might be neccessary in some cases)
(config-if)# switchport mode access

*turn on port security
(config-if)# switchport port-security

*set maximum value of MAC addresses to accept
(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum NUMBER (for example: 5)

*learn MAC addresses seen on the port, then allow only them
(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address sticky

*hardcode one MAC address to the port
(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address MAC ADDRESS

*specify what to do when a violation happens
(config-if)# switchport port-security violation ACTION 
(possible options: protect/restrict/shutdown)

*display the configuration
# show running-config
# show interfaces status
# show startup-config

*save current configuration
# write

*manually recover a shutdown port
(config-if)# shutdown
(config-if)# no shutdown
