***BASIC INFO***

main idea; when you connect two switches with multiple cabels they act as a single link and STP does not disable any ports into blocking state so that you can use full bandwidth

LAG (Link Aggregation)- aggregating a few links into one logical link

You can configure PortChannel as any other port; set an IP address, configure it as a trunk, enable PortFast and so on

Only interfaces of the same type might be bundelded into a PortChannel. For example, you canâ€™t put a FastEthernet interface in the same PortChannel where you put a GigabitEthernet


PortChannel options:

*static PortChannel- it is neccessary to hardcode the existence of the PortChannel on both devices

*LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) - widely used by different vendors
^active mode- will actively try to negotiate with the other device
^passive mode- will wait for the other side to initiate the 
negotiation

*PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol) - cisco property
^desirable mode- indicates that the device will try to negotiate
^auto mode- indicates that the device will wait for the other to negotiate


Due to the algorithm used in hashing function, interfaces numbers should be powers of 2 (2,4,8,...). This solution ensures more efficient packet transport



***CONFIGURATION***

1. Creating PortChannel static
(config)# int range INT ID
for example: int range gig1/0/1-3
(config-if)# channel-group ID mode on (ID of PortChannel e.g. 1)

2. Putting PortChannel into trunk mode
(config)# int PortChannel ID (ID of PortChannel)
(config-if)# switchport mode trunk

3. Creating PortChannel LACP
(config)# int range INT ID
(config-if)# channel-group ID mode MODE (active or passive)
 
3. Creating PortChannel PAgP
(config)# int range INT ID
(config-if)# channel-group ID mode MODE (desirable or auto)

4. Displaying PortChannel
